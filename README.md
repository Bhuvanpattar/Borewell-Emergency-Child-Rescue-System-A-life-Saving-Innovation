The Borewell Emergency Child Rescue System uses Arduino Uno, ESP32-CAM, and sensors (ultrasonic, sound, DHT11) for live monitoring and real-time data. A gripper driven by an L298N motor driver safely retrieves the child. Bluetooth control and Blynk IoT enable remote, efficient, and safer rescue operations. Applications: Emergency Rescue Operations, Rural Safety Solutions, IoT-based Life-Saving Systems, Disaster Response Automation, Remote Monitoring and Control, Embedded Safety Systems.
